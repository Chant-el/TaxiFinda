## Name
Project Name: TaxiFinda

## Description

The application is meant to give users access to a database of taxi ranks, all the taxis in them, and a database of taxis and their location(the rank where commuters can find them).

`Find taxi:`

User can input their destination and the application should return a list of taxi ranks that have taxis going to the required destination.

`Que:`

Non-commuter users would be the que marshall. This user would be able to que taxis up in a taxi rank to keep record of which one would be taking the next load of commuters. 

`User can see the price:`

Taxi data includes a fare for the taxi going to a given location.

## Support
